This is a sample webpage for my todo.txt libs. The repos for the libs are 

[todo.txt-parser](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-parser):  a todo.txt text parser library.

[todo.txt-indexer](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-indexer): an indexer library for todo.txt data items.

[todo.txt-store](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-store): a store library for working with todo.txt data items. 

This sample repo contains an usage example for storing todo.txt items in the url. To develop, clone the repo and run ```npm i``` and then ```npm run dev```.
