This is a sample webpage for my todo.txt libs. The repos for the libs are 

[todo.txt-parser](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-parser):  a todo.txt text parser library.
It provides a way to parse a todo.txt text and extract all the data in it.

[todo.txt-indexer](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-indexer): an indexer library for todo.txt data items.
The indexers also provide a way to search through the list of todos.

[todo.txt-store](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-store): a store library for working with todo.txt data items.
Provides a set of libraries for storing and retrieving todo.txt data items. You can store in local storage, text files and even a browser's url.

[todo.txt-export](https://github.com/ochuzor/todo.txt-export): a set of libraries for exporting todo.txt data items into strings, text files, and even a browser's url, which can be viewed and edited with this sample app.

This sample repo contains an usage example for storing todo.txt items in the url. To develop, clone the repo and run ```npm i``` and then ```npm run dev```.

You can play with it on: [url-todo-app](https://url-todo-app.surge.sh/). Take your todos with you by copying the url.
You can also export them into a text file that you can store or export them into a new url which you view and work wth using this app.
Either export everything or make a search and click the export to save the results into a text file or url.
